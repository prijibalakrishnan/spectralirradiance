## Contents
The repository has a collection of normalised spectral irradiance comparisons of three urban scenarios having different materiality.

- **plaster**:  outdoor environment enclosed with plaster facades
- **green**: outdoor environment enclosed with trees and grass ground cover
- **reflective**: outdoor environment enclosed with reflective glass facade.

The three urban scenarios are measured in Singapore under four different sky conditions *'clear', 'morning', 'evening', 'overcast'*. More details on the sky conditions, measurement set-up and recorded spectral irradiance of the skies can be found in the [equatorial skies repository](https://github.com/prijibalakrishnan/equatorialskies)

The upcoming conference publication *Spectral Rendering with Daylight: A Comparison of Two Spectral Daylight Simulation Platforms* has detailed information on the measurement set-up in the three urban environments and comparison between [LARK](http://faculty.washington.edu/inanici/Lark/Lark_home_page.html) and [ALFA](https://solemma.com/Alfa.html), the two currently available spectral daylight simulation platforms.
